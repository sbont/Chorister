## About
Chorister is an open source planning application for choirs and bands. It allows you to manage your repertoire, upload and share the scores, and keep track of setlists of your upcoming events. 
Ditch your spreadsheets and file repositories and start using chorister instead, today!

Chorister is free to use. Sign up at [chorister.co](https://chorister.co) for a free account.

## Contribute
By keeping this project open source, we can share this technology with every church band or choir in need of a planning tool without having to resort to expensive commercial tools. You can contribute towards this goal by logging an issue or filing a PR!
